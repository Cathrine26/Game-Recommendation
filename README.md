# Game-Recommendation
This project presents a Game Outcome Prediction system built using Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to analyze historical game data and create a model capable of predicting future match results based on patterns found in team performance, player statistics, and game-related features.

The notebook includes a complete workflow:
- Data Preprocessing: cleaning raw data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and preparing features for modeling.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): identifying trends, comparing team performance metrics, visualizing score distributions, and understanding which factors impact game outcomes.
- Feature Engineering: selecting and transforming key attributes to improve model accuracy.
- Model Development: training machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting to classify match outcomes.
- Model Evaluation: measuring performance using accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrices, and cross-validation.
